                <h1>Hi - I'm Jayesh, Product Designer with over 4 years of experience, crafting meaningful digital experiences that drive results.</h1>
                <p>I have a strong foundation in design and front-end web development, and I'm passionate about working on projects that drive business growth and align with user needs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve had the great privilege of collaborating on exciting projects with talented teams, including my recent experience at Stealth Monitoring, where I worked as a Web Designer in the Maps team. In this role, I was responsible for creating customer facing websites for Stealth’s clients. In 2018, I completed my co-op at CIBC as a UI Engineer with their Frontline Labs team, where I focused on creating prototypes for the bank’s employee-facing applications.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>When I am not designing, I enjoy taking pictures, supporting my favourite Formula 1 team, playing golf & cooking for my loved ones.</p>
